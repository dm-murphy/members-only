# Writers Only (Members Only)

This app is based on the Members Only authentication project from The Odin Project's Rails curriculum. The project focuses on the use of the Devise ruby gem in order to implement authentication for users. You can learn more about the assignment [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication#your-task-1).

In this app, Writers Only, anyone can view the stories that have been posted, but only logged in members can see the author names and view profiles.
